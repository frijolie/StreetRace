# Mille Bornes

## Game Outline
<ol>
<li>Deck is shuffled</li>
<li>Six cards are dealt to every player</li>
<li>Remainder of deck becomes the draw pile</li>
<li>Player draws a card</li>
<li>Player either plays or discards a card</li>
<li>Play continues until either:
  <ul>
  <li>One player reaches exactly 1,000 miles</li>
  <li>All players have played or discarded all of their cards</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

Note: play continues after the draw pile has been exhausted. Each player discards one card per
turn. Once every player runs out of cards in their hand and the draw pile is depleted, the game ends.

## Player Turns
Each turn a player may choose to play:
<ol>
<li>A Distance card, if a Roll card is on top of their BattlePile, on their own tableau</li>
<li>A Remedy card on top of the corresponding Hazard card in their own BattlePile</li>
<li>An End Limit card on top of a Speed Limit in their own SpeedPile</li>
<li>An Accident, Out of Gas, Flat Tire, or Stop Hazard card in their opponents BattlePile (if not empty)</li>
<li>A Speed Limit Hazard card in their opponents BattlePile if it is empty or an End Limit card.</li>
<li>A Safety Card in their own SafetyPile (at any time)</li>
<li>A Roll card in their own BattlePile if a Stop or Remedy card is on top, or if empty</li>
</ol>

## Rules
Once a Hazard card has been played in a BattlePile, the player may not play a Distance card until
they have played the respective Remedy card as well as a Roll card to resume play.

A different Hazard card may be played on top of the current Hazard card before it has been remedied.
The player with the Hazard only has to resolve the top most hazard resume.

Playing a Roll on top of a Stop allows the player to resume play. You do not need to play a second
Roll before a Distance card may be played.

Playing a Safety card, while a Hazard is active, immediately resolves the Hazard and protects the 
player against future Hazards for which it protects. The player still needs to play a Roll card before
they're able to play a Distance card. Whenever a SafetyCard has been played, this grants the player
an additional turn. They draw a new card and take an additional turn.

If a player has a Speed Limit they can only play a 25-Miles or 50-Miles Distance card until they
are able to play an End Limit.

A player cannot play more than 2 200-Miles cards in their DistancePile.

A 200-Miles card may be used in place of a Roll card.

Whenever a Hazard card is played, any player who holds the corresponding Safety card may immediately
play it and declare a coup-fourré. This may be done whether or not the player holding the Safety card
was the one that was attacked by the hazard.

This Safety card is laid horizontally in the SafetyPile and the player draws another card and immediately
takes their turn (even if it is out of turn). If that player was the one attacked with the Hazard card
the Hazard card is moved to the discard pile.

Players may always discard any card, even if they have a legitimate play available. A player who has
no playable cards must discard. Discards are considered dead and may not be used or touched for the
remainder of the game.

## The Tableau
* Hazard and Remedy cards are played in the BattlePile.
* SpeedLimit and EndLimit cards are played in the SpeedPile.
* Distance cards are played in separate stacks according to value.
* It is common to display the 200-mile cards distinctly, rather than fanned.
* Safety cards are played along the top of the tableau.
