/**
 * SafetyCardType is an enumeration of all possible values of a SafetyCard.
 * <p>
 * A SafetyCard is of type SafetyCardType and can only be played in a players SafetyPile.
 * SafetyCards are highly sought after because they have the highest point values, a special
 * strategy, and will prevent certain HazardCards from being played in a players BattlePile. If a
 * player possesses a SafetyCard in their hand, not already played on the Tableau, when an opponent
 * plays a HazardCard for which the SafetyCard prevents, the player can declare a coup-fourr√©. This
 * awards the player an additional 300 points and the player can immediately take another turn.
