/**
 * SafetyCard is a concrete class used to represent a card of type SafetyCardType.
 * <p>
 * A SafetyCard can only be played in the players SafetyPile. When a player has played a SafetyCard
 * this prevents certain types of HazardCards from being played in their BattlePile. There are only
 * four SafetyCards in the game so they are rare and have a high point value. SafetyCards also have
 * certain behavior and strategy. If a player has a SafetyCard in their hand, not on the Tableau,
 * and the opponent plays the HazardCard, which the SafetyCard in their possession prevents, the
 * player can declare a coup-fourr√© and play the SafetyCard. This disregards the Hazard and earns
 * the player 300 additional points.
 * <p>
 * Valid SafetyCards are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>PUNCTURE_PROOF</li>
 * <li>EXTRA_TANK</li>
 * <li>DRIVING_ACE</li>
 * <li>RIGHT_OF_WAY</li>
 * </ul>
